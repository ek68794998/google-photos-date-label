# Google Photos Date Label Appender
Runs JavaScript on the Google Photos page to add a date label to all photos.

# Installing
You will need some form of method to run arbitrary CSS and JavaScript in your browser. For Chrome, I use [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) for CSS and [CJS2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdk) for JavaScript. (Though the latter has some strange bugs, I have yet to find a better one.)

Once you have these, simply add the JavaScript and CSS from the files in this repository and run them.

# License
I didn't even bother licensing. Do whatever you want with it. All I ask is that you don't claim you made it.
